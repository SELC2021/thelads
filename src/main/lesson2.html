<h1>Introduction to Python Variables</h1>
</head>


<body>
<p>In Lesson 1, you learned about the basics of declaring variables. In this lesson, you will learn how variables work with each 
    other and how different variables work. As explained previously, in Python you don't have to declare most variables in a special way.
    You merely assign the variables with the type that you want to use, variables can even change type after assignment. Variables have
    different data types based on what you assign to them.

<p>The table below contains an organized list of variable declarations for most important variable types in Python. These lessons will not cover all of these, but this is merely meant to give you an overview of how easy it is to declare different things in Python</p>
<br>
<table class="tcenter">
<tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Data Type</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Name = "Jackson"</td>
    <td>String</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>num = 35</td>
    <td>Integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>num = 55.3</td>
    <td>Float</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>g = 3j</td>
    <td>Complex</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>My_Friends = ["Jackson", "Nathan","Akash"]</td>
    <td>List</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Foods = ("meat", "cheese", "fruit"</td>
    <td>Tuple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>happy = True</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
</tr>

<p>As stated previously, variables can change type after assignment. The code below is an example of this.</p>

<p>In the next lesson you will learn how to obtain user input into your variables and how to print them.</p>
