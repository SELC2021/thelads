    <p>
        Welcome to Lesson 1. This lesson will involve the basics of Python and Python Syntax. Python was created in 1991 and 
        is mainly used for software development, system scripting, and even web development in some cases.

        As stated previously, the focus of this lesson is on basic Python syntax. A key topic to first introduction is basic declaration of
        variables and the differences from other languages. Unlike some languges, there is no actual function for variable declaration in Python.
        It's as simple as setting your variable name equal to the variable content, as shown below.
