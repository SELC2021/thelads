<h1>Basic Mathmatics in Python</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
    Lesson 4 will be different from the past 3. This is an introduction to basic mathmatics functions in Python.
    This should serve as a bsaic introduction, and Python handles mathmatics in one of the most simple and intuitive ways. Let's go over addition and subtraction first.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When considering addition and subtraction, it's as simple as using two numbers with the associated operators, we can also use variables with this as well.
        The code below is simple, but an effective example of simple addition and subtraction involving variables.

    <p>As you can see, it's as simple as printing out the result after assigning c to the answer of our various questions. Below are the outputs of the code. Keep in mind that Python handles print statements by adding a newline at the end of it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Addition Problem = 10</p>
    <p>Subtraction Problem = 2</p>
    <br>
    <p>Multiplication and Division are just as straightforward, with a little more contigencies required. Keep in mind that when multiplying by a decimal number or dividing a number by something that would result in a decimal, the data type of your answer will change to a float. This can result in interesting errors or problems that you might have to deal with if not adequately prepared.</p>

    <p>In this context, the first variables are handled as integers, however, after being multiplied by the second variables, the data type results as being a float.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Multiplication Problem = 6.0 (A whole number, but still converted into a float!)</p>
    <p>Division Problem = 0.5</p>
